# Deliberation

## Overview

* I want Marloth to have deliberate gameplay
* Deliberate gameplay can easily become boring
* I've seen so many intriguing games that end up being tedious instead of fun
* Is it possible to create gameplay that is both deliberate and fun?
* What pitfalls should I avoid?
* What are some sample games that I found boring due to their deliberation?

## Samples of boring deliberation

| Game              | Deliberation        | Background                                                   | Problem Summ                                                 | Notes                                                        | Takeaway                                                     |

| Nethack           | Item identification | Players are expected to use esoteric techniques and game knowledge to identify items | Metagames like this work when they are  advanced layers of the game, but the becomes less accessible when metagaming becomes an essential part of the challenge. | Other Roguelikes such as Angband also feature unidentified items, but for such games, identification is less essential to victory and can be brute-forced. | Restrict metagame to advanced challenges, not basic challenges. |
| Tales of Maj'Eyal | Scouting            | Depending on character class, players are rewarded for using abilities to reveal areas ahead, sometimes needing to repeatedly rest before the abilities can be used again. | This would be less tedious if there were deadly threats around every corner, but even on the harder difficulties there can be areas where the player checks every corner only to find no signicant danger.  The number of steps in the manual process also became a little tedious. | I tried similar scouting techniques in Marloth and it too started to feel tedious. | Avoid repetitive sequences of steps.  Avoid tasks that have a high chance of being unneccesary. |
| Tales of Maj'Eyal | Equipment swapping  | On harder difficulties, the player is significantly rewarded for swapping out equipment on a case-by-case basis. | The UI is not designed to encourage this process.  The strategy feels like an awkward hack. |                                                              | Any mode switching in the UI should be streamlined.  Avoid rewarding players for tedious activities. |
