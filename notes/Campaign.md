# Campaign

What if the game played out a little like a campaign?

So far when viewing the single-map aspect of this game, I've seen it as a single map that the player can initially fully explore and the map gradually gets harder.

That can work, but what if some aspects of the map were guarded, and the player would need to gradually work toward getting past that guard?

Instead of the player simply leveling up enough until he can kill the guard, what if it was more a battle of attrition and setupâ€”more of an environmental battle?

For example, maybe the player could gradually plant or built sentries or something, but it would take several turns before there were enough of them to destroy the guard?

Or other forms of investment that would take one or more turns before it paid off and allowed the player to pass the guard?
