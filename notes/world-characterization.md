# The World as a Character

## Overview

* The main character of Dark Souls is Lordran, its world
* Ever since playing that game, I have occasionally been intrigued by the idea of personalized locations
* Marloth: A Child's Fairytale world did that to a small degree
* I haven't thought too much about the idea because I haven't determined the essence of the idea or how to apply it
* Periodically it has occurred to me that some direction like this would be the perfect solution to the Marloth game, because:
  * So much of my drive and focus has been creating a dynamic world that feels like it has a life of its own, independent of the denizens that populate it

## Analysis

### Single or many characters

#### Overview

* For some reason, the initial impression I had was of Lordran being a single character
* Technically, Lordran is divided into separate realms with distinct styles
* The more obvious interpretation would be to describe Lordran as a cast of characters
* So what caused my initial impression?

#### Theories

* Some possible explanations:
  * The transitions between realms are mostly seamless, and the realms do not appear to be at war with each other
    * The lore may contain some past wars, but there are no current wars
      * The realms are in conflict yet they seem to be harmoniously co-existing
  * Between the lore and implications in the design, there is a sense that the player is exploring a history, where each realm is a diorama depicting a scene in a story
    * It is like each scene is describing a series of states of the same character
      * "And here's a picture of your mother during her emo phase..."
  * The way the user experience unfolds, the player initially sees separate locations and then is surprised to discover how each location connects to other locations
    * The experiential contrast emphasizes a sense of unity
  * While the world is divided into different styles, much of the gameplay becomes a matter of the player deciding how to navigate the different realms, with planning involving paths crossing multiple realms
    * The emphasis being on how to navigate the realms as a whole, not individually
    * This is further emphasized in cases where some shortcuts involve briefly popping into one realm and quickly popping out of it again
      * For example, there is one useful route where the player descends an elevator into the Valley of the Drakes, and then promptly walks over to a cave entrance into Blight town
      * Another nearby example is a route involving briefly crossing the edge of the New Londo Ruins,
