# Passive Abilities

* I like the idea of exclusively using passive/auto abilities and no activated abilities
* Most abilities would still have an activity but activation would be triggered by certain circumstances
* Different triggers could be attached to abilities that specified the circumstances

* This is both a way of leverage a design pattern I like to call Molineux agency, or indirect agency: having the player interact with the world indirectly instead of directly
  * This has gained in popularity with games like Vampire Survivor
