# Primary Activities

## Summary

1. Navigation
2. Exploration
3. Avoiding dangers
4. Observation
5. Interacting with environment
6. Gathering resources

## Navigation

### Requirements

* Keep navigation simple, but squeeze every ounce of significance from it

### Background

* At first glance, navigating around a 3D world sounds boring
* Yet that is one of the primary actions of a first person shooter, and when I think about it, if the environment is interesting then I do enjoy walking around it
* This is in part how walking simulators have become a viable genre
* I've been fighting against this for years, and yet at the end of the day one of my biggest drives is to make a cool 3D world and how I love seeing 3D worlds from different angles, why wouldn't moving around that world be important?

### Design Challenges

* There is a danger that navigation as a primary activity, particularly when kept simple may prove boring
* In past experience and even through playtesting Marloth, faster player movement is more fun than slower player movement
  * Slow player movement can feel unresponsive and clunky
  * However, fast player movement hurts most forms of tactics
    * Games like DOOM 2016 started a wave of games that make fast movement conducive to tactics, but it is actually a narrow design that is already starting to get overused

### Non-goals

* An increasing trend in certain games that focus on traversal is to make it powerful and elaborate, but traversal here will be simple and limited
  * Elaborate traversal becomes more important when the world has greater distance between points of interest
    * Marloth worlds will be dense and compact

  * Powerful traversal can easily break gameplay, and is generally only successfully executed when the world and game are hand-crafted around the powerful traversal


## Exploration

* Exploration isn't normally something I look for in a game
* Yet I've avoided hand crafted maps and repeatedly gravitated toward procedurally generated maps
* Occasionally in a game I will get into exploration
  * Playing Minecraft is probably when I've enjoyed exploration the most
    * It would be worth listing other games that piqued my exploration interest

## Avoiding dangers

* Out of all of the primary activities, this is the one that immediately interests me the most
* I love engaging enemies in non-lethal, indirect means, and I feel like action games focus too much on permanently destroying threats instead of surviving them
* Indirect solutions also lend themselves better to tactics and strategy
  * When a game is about promptly killing everything in sight, threats become short term problems with little long-term impact beyond the question of how much player ammo and health they drained
  * Sometimes FPS games digress into a series of quickdraw scenarios—the difference between life and death is whether the player can turn a corner and get the drop on an enemy before they can attack

## Observation

* In order for observation to be meaningful for gameplay, the player must face choices that depend on questions which can only be answered through observation
* 

## Interacting with environment

* Specifically, particular game elements supporting the player interacting with them when facing them and pressing an interaction button
* By default these would contain immediate effects and some of them could involve a GUI menu
* 

## Gathering Resources

* This is something I never look for in games and rarely enjoy—I'm not a hunter/gatherer
* However, resource gathering keeps coming back as a perfect ingredient for rounding out this recipe
* Once again, maybe I can isolate the games with resource gathering which I enjoyed the most, and see if there are ways I can make the resource gathering more fun for someone like me
* It might help a little if the resources are finite, unlike many survival games where resources replenish infinitely and gathering becomes a fallback grind, similar to the way some RPGs fall back on level grinding
* Lately I'm thinking resource gathering can be further downplayed like I was originally wanting
