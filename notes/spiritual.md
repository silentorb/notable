# Spiritual Design

## Design Challenges

### Abstraction

#### Problems

* The spiritual realm is abstract
* 3D, and especially real-time first person 3D, is very concrete
* First person 3D is not well suited for directly depicting spiritual state

#### Solutions

* The Bible is full of concrete symbolism
  * What if spiritual state was depicted through symbolic game actors?
* Or maybe just keep it abstract and hidden, as a meta-game that the player only sees indirectly?

## Spiritual Game Scenarios

### Survival

* An idea I had a few years ago was that survival can be a powerful framework for moral choices and spiritual implications
* At the time I was toying with the extreme notion of a scenario of an entropic world where sooner or later all of the denizens will run out of resources and die
  * What would the player do then?
* While interesting and engaging on some level, it didn't sound fun
* Maybe that would still be a possibility, and maybe I could salvage some aspect of that
* Mortality is sobering, and this world could use a little sobering
* Survival can be both individual and communal

### Individual Protection

* The original spiritual game idea of mine back in the 90s, where the player would need to protect and guide a character through a treacherous environment
* Resident Evil 4 later implemented this idea, though only partially—have the irony of my vision was that the player could die but as long as the ward reached the end of the level, they would both spawn alive at the start of the next level
  * In other words, my version had a more profound depiction of sacrifice and spiritual causality

### Defense

* At one point I experimented with the player defending a community from invading monsters
* This scenario has a lot of value, I just didn't like how it became all about fighting.
* However, at this point I'm back to fighting-focused scenarios if they can provide enough spiritual depth

### Mortification

* One possibility is to focus on symbolizing spiritual warfare and having enemies be sins the players are slaying
* This would probably be close to a monster hunter scenario

### Destination

* So many games are ultimately about reaching a destination
* I've never really thought about a spiritual analogy for that before, but maybe there is one?
* My knee-jerk thought is Pilgrims Progress and how that is a journey with heaven being a final destination
* However, I've never related that much to the analogy
* I should be more heaven-minded than I am, but at the same time, I think part of the issue is personality.  My personality is just not geared toward journeys as an analogy.  The older I get the more I am a homebody, and I kind of want to make a homebody game.
* I think that's why I keep leaning toward a persistent, single map per playthrough
* I realize now how the setting I've been intuitively developing is a neighborhood—the player has a home and all of the player's adventures take place in the surrounding neighborhood.  I *like* that.
* So while it is useful to explore and be aware of, I don't think I'll go down the destination route

## Spiritual Game Mechanics

### Personal Growth

* The Bible talks a lot about growing in Spirit, and I've considered in the past how that could be tied in with classic RPG character growth
* I haven't explored this too far yet because first I have to nail the scenario before I can define character growth

### Co-Op Permadeath

* Co-Op games jump through hoops trying to soften player death
* What if I just ignored all of that and had a co-op game with permadeath, but where living and dying wasn't the main challenge, it's just every now and then players die
* It would be unpleasant, but it would give life and death more weight
* The player's would not be back until the group started a new game
* Similar to my other entries on permadeath, this would be accompanied by shorter playthroughs
* I'm also toying around with the idea of more sand-boxy goals where playthroughs go on indefinitely and players start a new one when they feel the current one has outlived its value
  * In that case, the more players that die, the more weight is added to wrapping up the current playthrough and starting a new one
