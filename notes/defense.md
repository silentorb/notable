# Defensive Gameplay

## Conclusion

*  At the end of the day, a splash of this element can add some fun but I don't want to focus on it because it relies too much on slaughter

## Motivation

* I've always enjoyed passive, defensive gameplay
  * This is probably due in part to
    * My being more reactive than proactive
    * Defense usually involves some form of general preparation/investment in the future
* I've been trying to convert the TWOLD narrative to gameplay for years
* The core element to convert is family provision
* I've been seeing family provision as a form of survival
* Most survival games I'm familiar with revolve around resource gathering and crafting
  * Two game mechanics that have never interested me

## Tower Defense

* The most common defense game is tower defense
* But I don't really want to make a tower defense game
* I like the idea of placing some towers, but I don't want the game to be all about towers
* Neither do I want the game to be all about busy work like some tower defense games mix in
* Nor do I want to the game to be about hordes of enemies
  * I don't want the game to escalate into raw mechanics like most tower defense games do

## Dungeon Defenders

* Oddly, I don't think of Dungeon Defenders much when I think of tower defense
* Part of that is there are so many things I don't like about Dungeon Defender's design
* However, Dungeon Defenders is a great example of a real-time, third-person defense game and possibly the best jumping board for me to build from
* Bringing up Dungeon Defenders begs the question "What about Orcs Must Die?"
  * I've never liked Orcs Must Die as much, though most of my play of Dungeon Defenders has been local co-op, something Orcs Must Die didn't support, so that may be the biggest issue
  * Orcs Must Die is less of an RPG
  * I prefer the art and atmosphere of Dungeon Defenders
  * Orcs Must Die puts a little more weight on player combat, which I find boring in both games

#### Tower Defense

* Maybe I should bite the bullet and just make this into a tower defense game?
* Why am I adverse to focusing on towers?
  * They make the game too abstract, even when they are presented as stationary characters
    * How do they make the game abstract?  Are the towers inherently abstract or do they indirectly lead to more abstract gameplay?

  * Focusing on towers tends to naturally lend itself to mindless hordes of cannon fodder
    * In other words, towers work well because they are simple, but that simplicity almost requires an equally simple opposition
    * There may be a way of subverting this

* Why am I adverse to allowing players to place towers where they choose?
  * It almost seems like it gives the player so much freedom that the game becomes all about that freedom
  * In a way, it trivializes the environment
    * The most important aspect of the environment becomes how it statically influences your tower placement options
    * The environment becomes less a thing to be interacted with and more a canvas for towers
  * Maybe part of the issue is unless a tower is placed by a level designer, they don't really tightly integrate with the environment, they are just sitting there
    * For some reason I'm not bothered in the same way by characters and items
      * Maybe part of it is because towers are stationary—since they are stationary it feels like they should have a deeper relationship with their surroundings
      * Maybe that also is part of why player-placed towers feel more abstract

  * It can lead to lots of spatial glitches and whack-a-mole patching of fringe-case bugs
  * Player tower placement reduces the sense of indirect agency
    * No longer is the player subtly influencing their environment—they are directly shaping it
    * Instead of an existing conflict where the player is assisting one of the sides, the player *is* one of the sides

* Would it be possible for the MVP to be tower defense and instead of focusing on that feature throughout later versions, keep the tower defense elements light and instead add additional domains in later installments?
  * Have I ever seen a game successfully pivot like this?
    * If not, maybe I can isolate exactly what the pitfall is and find a solution?
    * The closest example I've seen, which is a major influence on my understanding of defense games, is WarCraft III
      * WarCraft III started off as a traditional RTS game, but most of the appeal for me ended up being its custom maps with their various combinations and mixes of offense and defense
      * Culminating in DotA leaving a larger legacy than the RTS aspects of WarCraft III

## The Idea

* What if I combined what I always loved about AOS maps and some other WC3 defense maps where an existing battle is going on and the player is simply trying to shift the tide of battle?
* Instead of placing towers as the primary defense, what if defenses were already established and the player is trying to enhance and maintain what is already in place?
  * My main inspiration for this is Grim Dawn, where the towns have barricades manned by AI units that pick off random lesser monsters that are periodically spawned to throw themselves at the entryways
    * These set pieces are practically static and the player never directly interacts with them, but its still enough to paint the picture for the scenario
* Tying back to one of my earlier simulation game ideas, the emphasis would be on entropy—the situation is slowly decaying and the player is simply trying to hold back the decay for a certain period of time
* This would allow one of the most seamless paths I've had yet to multi-domain
  * The offense/defense could be purely combat-oriented for MVP
  * In later versions additional dependencies could be introduced with attacks on those dependencies
    * For example, food and nourishment could be introduced, with certain kinds of attacks that do not perform perform combat damage but instead destroy food, causing people to starve
* Similar to Dungeon Defenders, different waves could come from different directions, shifting focus from one part of the map to another, introducing some incentive for the player to move around and making the locations less stale
* Instead of defending crystals, the player would defend people
* In later versions some degree of offense could be introduced as well, such as assaulting a fortress that is spawning endless waves of enemies
