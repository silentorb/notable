# Personal Interest

## Primary Motivations

1. Traverse an interesting 3D world
2. Convey spiritual principles
3. RPG-style character growth
4. Something to play with my sons

## Style

As a player, what do I look for in games?

### Dark fantasy

* My favorite settings are dark fantasy
* Occasionally I play games in other settings for other reasons, but I would always like them more if they were dark fantasy

### Beauty

* I want the game to have beautiful art
* The art doesn't need to be high fidelity or AAA quality
* Instead, the art needs to be well-designed, aesthetically pleasing, and fresh

### Sense of story

* I don't need an elaborate plot, just a sense of story
* This can be mostly stylistic and in a pinch can be rammed into most anything

### Surrealism

* This is sort of a sub-category under dark fantasy, but I love surreal settings and level design

## 3D

### Different perspectives with seamless transitions

* This is one of the main reasons I love 3D, is the ability to see things from different perspectives
* My favorite example of this is Dark Souls, where you see a castle in the distance, and later you end up at that castle, looking back at your previous vantage point
* Being seamless is also important here—simply being able to teleport to that other location or doing so in turns wouldn't have the same effect
  * Being seamless increases the sense of wonder—the surprise at how following a continuous and unbroken thread can result in such a radically different place

### Immersive

* Being immersive is not as important to me as some, but it is still important
* I'm not into VR or AR
* I am happy with 3D first person realtime games on a tradtional desktop PC

## Roguelite

### Character growth

* I love games with growth
* I love it even more when that growth feels personal

### Creativity

* This usually revolves around composition
  * One of the classic examples being Magic the Gathering's use of combining cards to form a deck

### Optimization

* I love min/maxing
* I have to be careful of this one in particular because it can feed an obssessive side of me that drowns out everything else

### Permadeath

* I would rather start over with a clean slate than need to rely on save-scumming, checkpoints, or grinding

### Short playthroughs

* With permadeath in mind, I don't like having massive amounts of investment that can get lost in a moment
  * As I've probably written about in other places, that actually reduces the challenge, forcing players to turtle and avoid danger
* I prefer to fail fast

### Unique playthroughs

* I dislike static, scripted scenarios
* I don't like it when games reward/punish you based on your knowledge of upcoming terrain
  * The one exception to this is competitive games like Paladins where the maps are reocurring arenas, then knowledge of the map is more general than specific
* Part of why I prefer unique playthroughs is because I prefer rewarding general over specific knowledge, and unique playthroughs reward general knowledge

### Open-ended

* I don't like wrote, single-solution challenges
* I prefer games to have problems with multiple possible solutions
* This ties in with the creativity item

## Misc

### Strategy

* I love planning ahead, though mostly at a high level, not planning out the details
* I quickly grow tired of chess-like planning ahead of precise moves and contingencies
* I like fuzzier strategy where there are more unknowns and it is less practical to quantify the possible outcomes

#### Consideration

* I'm putting this under strategy for simpler cross-relationships
* In general, I don't like being rushed in games
* I play a lot of action games and have fairly quick reaction speeds, but at the end of the day I prefer pondering than knee-jerk reactions

### Local Co-Op

* Playing games with my sons

### Challenge

* Paladins is one of the games few games where I'll play the same basic scenario over and over again because every time feels like a fresh challenge

#### Structured Goals

* I've never been a fan of sandboxes
  * My outlet for that degree of creativity is making things from scratch, not within an existing game
* I prefer well defined goals and achievement

### Spiritually Edifying

* I rarely play games that are spiritually edifying, but if there was a game that had many of these attributes and was spiritually edifying, it would be one of my favorite games

### Minimal combat

* I mostly play fighting games, but that's only because so many of the things I am looking for are only packaged with fighting
* When possible, I usually gravitate toward pacifism
  * I always liked how the first episode of Heretic was more about dodging than shooting, and most of the game could be completed simply via agility
  * When playing immersive sims, I usually focus on stealth and non-lethal means

### Cozy

* I love it when games have a sense of coziness
* Unfortunately, that is rarely packaged with the other things I look for in games, though I think that is slowly changing

## Secondary

### Adventure

* There's an intangible quality to the classic D&D notion of gathering a party of adventurers and setting out into the wild unknown
* I have a romantic nostalgia that keeps pulling me back to that

### Exploration

* Exploration is not my favorite part of games or a quality I actively seek out, yet more and more I'm realizing that is a subtle but important element to what I like in games
* I think part of the problem is often exploration is done poorly, and I don't like poor exploration, and sometimes I throw out the baby with the bath water

### Indirect agency

* I don't like micromanagement
* I like make sweeping decisions and letting the game sort out the details

### Complexity

* Rewarding investment

### Persistence

* Within a playthrough, I've rarely been a fan of journey's being broken up into discreet areas with no back-tracking
* Persistence ties in with the increasingly popular design notion of "choices matter"—persistence gives decisions longer-term consequences
  * So many games revolve around decisions that don't have significant impact beyond the next few minutes

### Dense content

* I'm more of a quality over quantity person
* I don't like it when things are spread out
* I like locations crammed with things to do
* Density is my art style in general—I tend to make art that doesn't have a lot of detail but the details are crammed together

### Dynamic Worlds

* I like games where you revisit previous locations and things have changed, or levels that mutate over the course of a playthrough
  * Some DOOM maps are amazing at this
  * BioShock 3 does this in a hamfisted manner that I don't care for at all
* MineCraft has extremely dynamic maps, but it is so dynamic that the dynamic nature is somewhat cheapened
  * In most games with dynamic environments, its a *surprise* when the environment changes

### Interactive Environments

* While I was mixed about this direction in the 90s, in recent years I've increasingly become fascinated by Build-engine interactivity
* Fitting with the dense content idea, I like the idea of a world where the player can walk into a room and interact with things all over that room

Just for contrast, here's a slice of a table if 3D was replaced with an abstract UI (that could still have some embedded 3D elements but wouldn't be a free roaming perspective)
